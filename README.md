# deep-learning-challenge


  1.  Overview: The goal is to use deep learning techniques to create a predictive model for organizational success. The dataset comprises features describing different organizations. The aim is to build a classification model that can predict the success of an organization based on its characteristics.

  2.  Results: 

  -  Data Preprocessing

      -  The target variable for the model is "IS_SUCCESSFUL".
      -  Features for the model include all columns except for `EIN`, which was dropped.
      -  "EIN" column was removed.

  3.  Summary: The model achieved an accuracy of about 78% on the test data and a corresponding loss of 0.45. Another model to consider is the Random Forest model because this model could offer alternative solutions for this classification problem.
